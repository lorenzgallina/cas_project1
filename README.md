This is a simple note/todo application.

### Installing

1. Unzip the template.
2. Install the dependencies of the template:
    - Open your console/terminal and navigate to the root of the project.
    - Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
    - Optional: Run `npm install --global http-server` 

## Running the App

Before running the app, make sure to start the backend server:

1. Navigate to the `api` folder in the project root: `cd api`.
2. Start the backend server with `node index.js`.
3. Start the frontend in a new terminal, my approach(needs Optional step from Intsalling): navigate in the projects directory and enter: http-server 
4. Now you should be able to test the application, while frontend and backend runs simultanously
